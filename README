This is a program that will updated the wallpaper to match the top hit on some subreddit.

This program requires that the Python Imageing Library (PIL) is installed.

This program requires that python-argparse is installed or the default python version is 2.7+

To run

0) clone this repository

1) copy its contents into a folder called reddit_wallpaper somewhere on your path

2) call: python reddit_wallpaper [options] [subreddit1 [subreddit2 ...]]
  (you might want to make this into a small script and put it in your ~/bin folder or another thing on your path.)

This program has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux 10.04.3 but I have reason to believe it will work on any system which uses gconf to store the background file name.

if you download this and want to use it place the contents in a folder called reddit_wallpaper somewhere on your python path.
