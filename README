This is a program that will updated the wallpaper to match the top hit on some subreddit.

This program requires that the Python Imageing Library (PIL) is installed.

This program requires that python-argparse is installed or the default python version is 2.7+

This program requires python-setuptools to install an executable to your path so you do not need to write one yourself although you can just use distutils

you need to make sure that the download location exists before running. (By default ~/.background_getter)

To run

0) clone this repository

1) install by running python setup.py install

2) call: reddit-wallpaper [options] [subreddit1 [subreddit2 ...]]

This program has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux 10.04.3 but I have reason to believe it will work on any system which uses gconf to store the background file name.
