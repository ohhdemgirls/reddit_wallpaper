This is a program that will updated the wallpaper to match the top hit on some subreddit.

This program requires that the Python Imageing Library (PIL) is installed.

This program requires that python-argparse is installed or the default python version is 2.7+

To run

0) clone this repository

1) install by running python setup.py install

2) call: reddit-wallpaper [options] [subreddit1 [subreddit2 ...]]

This program has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux 10.04.3 but I have reason to believe it will work on any system which uses gconf to store the background file name.
