What I still need to do.

Make it work with GSettings
Move the main steps from background_getter.py to __init__.py
Make it create A SINGLE directory if need be
Give it a config file
add config option to make it only download
Change the save-file spec so that one can control the file extension.
Make it possible to always save as a specific type.
